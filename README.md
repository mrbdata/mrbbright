# Employee attrition

Employee attrition, often known as voluntary turnover, is a significant issue for businesses since it impacts productivity, work sustainability, and long-term growth objectives. This paper analyzed the IBM HR dataset to predict employee retention. We compared the performance of linear (logistic regression) and non-linear (random forest) machine learning models using PySpark. When compared across multiple matrices like accuracy, F1 score, area under ROC curve, the random forest model beat the logistic regression model.
